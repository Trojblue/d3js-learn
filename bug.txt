ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 3) and beautifulsoup4==4.8.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.                                                                                                                            

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested beautifulsoup4==4.8.0
    lyricsgenius 1.4.0 depends on beautifulsoup4==4.6.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
